Reflection:

using the commands in the terminal is something that I have to spend more time practicing and understanding

Git add and commit are starting to make sense but i am having trouble understanding how they work together

much of the html was review

If I am correct, you use add, commit, and push as a way to add updates only when you are adding something new to github/ uploading it. hm.
